    "content": "React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. They allow you to manage state and side effects in functional components, which simplifies the component logic and makes your code more readable.\n\nCommon hooks include `useState` for managing state, `useEffect` for side effects, and `useContext` for accessing context. Hooks can be composed to create custom hooks that encapsulate reusable logic."

    "content": "MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It’s designed to handle large volumes of data and scale horizontally across multiple servers. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB uses a schema-less data model, which allows for more flexibility in the data structure.\n\nDocuments in MongoDB are organized into collections, and you can perform various operations like querying, indexing, and aggregating data. MongoDB's ability to handle unstructured data makes it suitable for modern applications that require agility and scalability."

    "content": "Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It helps you manage the application state in a consistent way by using a central store and actions to update the state.\n\nIn Redux, actions describe changes, and reducers process these actions to update the state. This unidirectional data flow simplifies debugging and testing by providing a clear structure for managing state changes, making Redux a valuable tool for complex applications."

Webpack optimizes your build process by bundling, minifying, and managing dependencies.\n\nWebpack's configuration allows you to specify entry points, output locations, and apply transformations using loaders and plugins. This flexibility helps you manage assets like CSS, images, and JavaScript efficiently, resulting in improved performance and maintainability of your codebase."

    "content": "TypeScript interfaces define the structure of an object and can be used to enforce specific shapes for objects. They provide a way to create contracts for objects, ensuring that they adhere to the required structure.\n\nInterfaces can be used to describe function signatures, class shapes, and complex data structures. They help maintain type safety and improve code readability by documenting the intended use of objects and enforcing consistent usage throughout your codebase."
